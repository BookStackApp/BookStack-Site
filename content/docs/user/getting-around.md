There's many ways to get around and find content within your BookStack instance
outside of following the core heirachy. The below details some of the main methods:

### Book Sidebar

The book sidebar is visible when within a book, and it reflects the full ordered heirachy 
of the book you are within. If you are within a chapter, that chapter will be expanded by
default otherwise they will be collapsed & expandable with a click.

### Next & Previous Links

When viewing a page or chapter, you'll find links below that content that allow you to
navigate between the next & previous content within the current book.
These links will reflect sibling content, or the next item within the parent level is no next/previous sibling exists.

### Breadcrumbs

As you dive into your BookStack content you'll see breadcrumbs above 
the main content area to reflect the parent path of the current item.
These will begin with the "Books" page unless
you've travelled through the "Shelves" view in which case this would begin with
the "Shelves" view and parent shelf.

You can click on items to jump directly to those. You can also click the 
arrows between items to search and jump to orthagonal content within 
the structure heirachy.

### Search

A major way to find and jump to content is by using search.
There's the global search input in the header, where you can search across all content in your instance:

When you start a global search, you'll get live feedback showing a preview of search results.
You can press enter or "View All" to view all relevant results on the search page.
On book and chapter views, you'll also find search inputs allowing you to search just within that book or chapter.

Find more information on our [Searching Content](/docs/user/searching/) page.

### Activity Lists

Many views, like that for a book or on the homepage, will show a list of
"Recent Activity", reflecting recent actions that have been made relevant to the
current context.
On these, you can click the name of the item within the listed activity to jump to that item.

### Recently Updated List

On the homepage you can find a "Recently Updated" list, showing the lasted pages
to have been created or updated.
You can press "View All" to view a larger paginated list.

### Favourites

One way to easily recall content is by adding it to your favourites.
You can choose to favourite any shelf, book, chapter or page to add it 
to your personal favourite collection. 
You can then easily find your favourites, either as a list on the homepage
or via the "My Favourites" link in the header profile dropdown.
