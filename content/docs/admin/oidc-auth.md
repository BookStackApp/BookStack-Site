OpenID Connect (OIDC) can be used within BookStack as a primary method of authentication.
This replaces the default email & password authentication mechanism.
BookStack supports a simple level of auto-discovery to ease endpoint and key management.

When used, BookStack will attempt to match the OIDC user to an existing BookStack user
based on the "External Authentication ID" value stored against the Bookstack user. 
If this match cannot be made, BookStack will effectively auto-register that user to 
provide a seamless access experience. They will be given the default role set under the
"Default user role after registration" option in the application settings. 

### Requirements & Limitations

Listed below are some considerations to keep in mind in regard to BookStack's OIDC implementation:

- Only RS256 is currently supported as a token signing algorithm, Token encryption is not supported.
- Discovery covers fetching the auth & token endpoints, in addition to parsing any keys at the JWKS URI,
  from the `<issuer>/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint.
  - Issuer discovery is not supported.
- Group/Role handling is not currently supported but feedback, in the form of IDP-provided group examples, is welcome to help future implementation.

### BookStack Configuration

To set up OIDC based authentication add or modify the following variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Set OIDC to be the authentication method
AUTH_METHOD=oidc

# Control if BookStack automatically initiates login via your OIDC system 
# if it's the only authentication method. Prevents the need for the
# user to click the "Login with x" button on the login page.
# Setting this to true enables auto-initiation.
AUTH_AUTO_INITIATE=false

# Set the display name to be shown on the login button.
# (Login with <name>)
OIDC_NAME=SSO

# Name of the claims(s) to use for the user's display name.
# Can have multiple attributes listed, separated with a '|' in which 
# case those values will be joined with a space.
# Example: OIDC_DISPLAY_NAME_CLAIMS=given_name|family_name
OIDC_DISPLAY_NAME_CLAIMS=name

# OAuth Client ID to access the identity provider
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=abc123

# OAuth Client Secret to access the identity provider
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=def456

# Issuer URL
# Must start with 'https://'
OIDC_ISSUER=https://instance.authsystem.example.com

# Enable auto-discovery of endpoints and token keys.
# As per the standard, expects the service to serve a 
# `<issuer>/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint.
OIDC_ISSUER_DISCOVER=true

############################################################
## NOTE: The below are only needed if not using the above ##
##       auto-discovery option.                           ##
############################################################

# Path to identity provider token signing public RSA key
OIDC_PUBLIC_KEY=file:///keys/idp-public-key.pem

# Full URL to the OIDC authorize endpoint
OIDC_AUTH_ENDPOINT=https://instance.authsystem.example.com/v1/authorize

# Full URL to the OIDC token endpoint
OIDC_TOKEN_ENDPOINT=https://instance.authsystem.example.com/v1/token
```

A user in BookStack will be linked to an OIDC provided account via the `sub` claim.
If the value of this ID changes in the identity provider it can be updated in BookStack, 
by an admin, by changing the "External Authentication ID" field on the user's profile.

### Callback URL

Should your OIDC provider require a callback URL, the following can be used: `https://example.com/oidc/callback`.
Change `https://example.com` to be the base URL of your BookStack instance.

### Switching to OIDC with Existing Users

When switching `AUTH_METHOD` from `standard` to `oidc`, BookStack will not 
link OIDC user accounts to existing BookStack users, where the email address is 
matching, since the "External Authentication ID" value of the existing BookStack user does 
not match the unique user ID provided by the OIDC system.

You can overcome this situation by logging into BookStack with an admin account while `AUTH_METHOD=standard`.
While logged in, change `AUTH_METHOD` to `oidc`.
This change of authentication method will show an "External Authentication ID" text
field, below the name and email inputs, when viewing a user account in BookStack.
Here you can enter the unique user ID that would be provided by your OIDC provider.
Once saved BookStack will then use this value to match OIDC and BookStack user 
accounts upon next login attempt.

If you need to update accounts in bulk, you could instead directly update the 
`external_auth_id` field of the `users` table within your BookStack database.

### Debugging

To help when setting up or configuring BookStack to use your OIDC system, the below
`.env` option can help provide more insight:

```bash
# Dump out the details fetched from the identity provider.
# Only set this option to true if debugging since it will block logins
# and potentially show private details.
OIDC_DUMP_USER_DETAILS=false
```

Further to this, details of any BookStack errors encountered can be found by following
our [general debugging documentation](/docs/admin/debugging/).
