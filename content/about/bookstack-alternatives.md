title: "Other Open Source Documentation Platforms"
---

BookStack is not the solution for everyone, and we don't intend to be.
The right platform for your documentation can be very specific to your content, audiences, use-case, and preferences.
It's usually best to trial a range of options to see what works best for you.

Below we've listed a range of wonderful alternative fully free and open source options that may be worth reviewing.
We won't rank or compare these, since we'll naturally have a biased view and such comparisons can lack nuance as
to what makes each option great, so it's best to discover the styles & benefits of each platform for yourself 
to see how they fit your use-case.

### Static Site Generators

Using a specific wiki/documentation platform may not always be the most suitable option.
If your editors are primarily developer-focused, and you have a specific vision that you want build to,
static site generators can often be a great solution that provides a lot of control over the output.
These are systems used to build websites from a range of markdown (or other format) content.
We even use one (Hugo) for this website, blog and documentation pages!
Here are some popular options in this area:

- **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)** - A fast static generator built on Go.
- **[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)** - A static-site generator leveraging the full power of React.
- **[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)** - A static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation.
- **[11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)** - A simpler static site generator built on NodeJS.
- **[VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/)** - Vite & Vue Powered Static Site Generator.


### Other Forms of Documentation

Documentation isn't fixed to a specific format, there are loads of formats that can be used to document,
many of which you may find more fun. The best form is the one you'll actually use.
A good example of this is a blog, which you could use to document ideas and projects as you go.
Over time this can build up to become a useful repository of information and documentation that you
can refer back to.

For some other ideas like using forums, GitHub issues, and videos, you can read our
