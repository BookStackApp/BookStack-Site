### How did BookStack start?

[Dan Brown](https://danb.me/) started building BookStack in 2015 while looking for a documentation 
platform to use for his mixed-technical-skilled workplace.
Most service offerings incurred per-user costs, and most established open source offerings didn't 
quite hit the mark in terms of design & usability, at least out-of-the-box.
Therefore, with a few years' development experience, Dan thought he could whip up a solution that worked for his use-case.

During the first few months there was significant design iteration as can be seen [in this blogpost](/blog/1-year-of-bookstack/).
Eventually the design, name & hierarchy came together to form pretty much the same BookStack we know today.

The project was first officially outwardly announced [via the /r/selfhosted subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/3z06rb/bookstack_a_free_wikilike_information_store/) which received fairly positive feedback.
BookStack remained published under the "Beta" status for a few years, until it was eventually [dropped in 2021](/blog/bookstack-release-v21-04/)
although little actually changed in regard to development and target stability, since stability had long been a core value.

### What are the core goals of BookStack?

BookStack aims to be an opinionated wiki system that provides a pleasant and simple out-of-the-box experience.
New users to an instance should find the experience intuitive and only basic word-processing skills should be
required to get involved in creating content on BookStack.
The platform should provide advanced power features to those that desire it but they should not interfere
with the core simple user experience.

BookStack aims to be free (both monetarily & in liberty) and open source, focusing on the core use-case
and audience that's it's built for instead of expanding to a wider, or more financially fruitful, audience.

In regard to development, BookStack aims for a relaxed, open, positive & stable approach.
The platform should evolve & improve steadily & stable over time, with a focus on
stability, maintainability and forward-compatibility instead of chasing new
features, technologies or audiences.

### Who works on BookStack?

The project is led by, and primarily maintained by, the creator [Dan Brown](https://danb.me/).
There are also a [significant amount](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/blob/development/.github/translators.txt)
of community members who work to translate the BookStack interface into many other languages.
Upon that, there are many other folks in our community that help with contributing code, reporting & managing issues, 
provide input, or just get involved within our communities.
