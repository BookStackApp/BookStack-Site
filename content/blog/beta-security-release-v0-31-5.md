BookStack v0.31.5 has been released. As with the previous release (v0.31.4) this updates the Laravel framework version used to help avoid a potential vulnerability when requests were crafted in a certain manner. While it is not known if such a case exists in BookStack, this release updates the framework as a pre-emptive measure.
