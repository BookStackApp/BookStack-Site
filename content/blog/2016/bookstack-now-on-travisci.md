BookStack now has continuous integration set up and connected to the GitHub repo. Now whenever code is pushed, or a pull request is created, the tests will be automatically be ran against the new code.

[The BookStack CI builds can be found here.](https://travis-ci.org/ssddanbrown/BookStack)

Initial it was set-up on CodeShip but I moved it to TravisCI due to the build details not being publicly visible on CodeShip which was a big disappointment.
