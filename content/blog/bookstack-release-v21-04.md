Today is the launch of BookStack v21.04 which is our next feature release after Beta v0.31.
For this release we're dropping the beta and changing our version scheme as detailed below. 
This release has no single major feature but is instead focused on a range of fixes, improvements and community contributions.

* [Update instructions](https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/admin/updates)
* [GitHub release page](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/releases/tag/v21.04)


**Upgrade Notices**

- PHP 7.3 or greater is now required to run BookStack. If you previously installed BookStack using the 18.04 script, please see the details of this release in our [update notes](/docs/admin/updates/#updating-to-v2004-or-higher) for the commands that should help you upgrade to PHP 8.
- User profile pages, and user-based search filters, now use name-based "slugs" rather than being ID based. Any old links or instructions you may have for these elements may need to be updated.

### Dropping the Beta Status & Changing our Version Scheme

As mentioned above, after collecting [some feedback on GitHub](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/issues/2570), I'm dropping the beta status from any versions and release notes. 
In terms of stability and code, nothing really is changing.
BookStack has been fairly stable for a while now, and I've always attempted to ensure a stable upgrade path on releases.
My primary reason for keeping the beta status was really to omit a little extra liability, and I was hesitant to label any release as `v1.0` since I could not define a reasonable criteria for `v1.0` that I'd be happy with.
The beta status was causing issues for some people, where their hosting/platform would not provide any support due to the beta flag.


In terms of version numbers, we're jumping from Beta v0.31 to BookStack v21.04. 
As mentioned above, I couldn't really define a `v1.0` so we're skipping right over it and using the Ubuntu versioning system as inspiration.
BookStack versions will now be in the format of v`<2 DIGIT YEAR>`.`<2 DIGIT MONTH>`[.`<OPTIONAL PATCH DIGIT>`]. As an example:

- v21.06 _(June 2021 launched feature release)_
- v21.06.5 (Fifth patch of June 2021 release, even if released in a later month)
- v22.10 _(October 2022 launched feature release)_

That change is technically compatible with the old versioning, while now providing context about the release date within the version. 
This can be extremely useful when people reference their BookStack version as it'll instantly provide context of release date without needing to look that up.

### Support for Custom Footer Links

Some scenarios, such as those for GDPR compliance, require links to be shown on every page.
To support these cases, You can now add custom footer links to your BookStack instance via the settings page:

![BookStack Footer Settings Interface](/images/2021/04/footer_settings.png)

You can specify the URL and text for each link. The description of the setting details how you can use the BookStack translation system to automatically translate some common phrases such as "Privacy Policy" and "Terms of Service".

Once set, these will be shown at the bottom of almost every view including those that are public such as the login & register pages.

Thanks to [@james-geiger](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/pull/1973) for pushing this forward and providing an initial implementation of this feature.

### Search Content by Owner

Within search inputs, and on the search page, it's now possible to search for content belonging to a specific owner:

Thanks to [@benediktvolke](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/pull/2561) for implementing this feature.

### Backend Theme System

Using the existing theme folder system, it's now possible to customize back-end PHP functionality without altering core project files.
To set this up you'd create a `functions.php` file within your theme folder, in which you can use specific events we expose. For example:

```js
<?php

use BookStack\Facades\Theme;
use BookStack\Theming\ThemeEvents;

Theme::listen(ThemeEvents::APP_BOOT, function($app) {
    \Log::info('BookStack was booted up!');
});
```

This system is documented within the project source itself, and can be [viewed on GitHub here](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/blob/release/dev/docs/logical-theme-system.md).

The intention of this system is provide a mechanism for people to implement back-end functionality that's not suited to be in the core project.

**Note:** This system is considered to be in beta for this release version as I'll be gathering feedback on this initial implementation to potentially make further changes if needed.

### Sort Control within Shelves

Sort options have been previously available within the books & shelves listings.
This update brings sort options for viewing books within a shelf.

![BookStack Shelf Sort Display Example](/images/2021/04/shelf_sort.png)

This defaults to the user-defined order, managed via editing a shelf, but this allows custom ordering by name, updated date or created date.
Sort ordering changes are saved to the current user session.

Thanks to [@guillaumehanotel](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/pull/2515) for providing the initial implementation for this feature.


### Audit Log User Filter

The audit log has been updated with the ability to search for activities created by a specific user in the system:

### Healthcheck Endpoint

A healthcheck endpoint is now included in the system which can be useful in automated and high-availability scenarios.
This endpoint will perform some simple checks on the database, cache & session, then return the status of each as JSON:

```js
{"database":true,"cache":true,"session":true}
```

### LDAP TLS Support

Proper TLS support has now been added to BookStack. This can be enabled by adding `LDAP_START_TLS=true` to your `.env` file.
When enabled, BookStack will ensure a TLS connection is made. 
If the TLS connection fails for any reason then an error will be thrown.

Thanks to [@Body4](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/pull/2376) for pushing this forward with a contributed implementation.

### PHP 8.0 Support

PHP 8.0 is now supported by BookStack. This was a fair bit more involved than previous PHP 7.x support due to PHP 8.0 being a fairly big release
which included a fair few breaking changes. Due to dependency support, we've had to bump the minimum supported PHP version to PHP 7.3 from 7.2.5.

### Dark Mode by Default Option

It's now possible to set dark mode as the default visual option for an instance. This can be set by adding the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
APP_DEFAULT_DARK_MODE=true
```

Note that this may be overridden by any user's session or set preference.

### Next Steps

For the next release I want to continue to resolve some of the pending pull requests on GitHub.
For a few of these I've been waiting until I can build a back-end customization system, as done in this release, so some requests will be directed to use
that system instead of including changes in core, which should give the system a good initial test.
I hope to work through the outstanding SAML issues if I can get a working active directory set-up to replicate and test.

During this cycle I'll be starting to think about the next step on the roadmap, where we'll be reviewing the editors used in BookStack. There probably won't be any coding for the feature during this cycle but I'll be raising proposals and/or RFCs to plan this out.

MFA is an subject that would be good to takle soon but working on auth components can get tiresome, especially as this is an area where people often need configurability.

Since we've now bumped the minimum required PHP version to 7.3, I'll probably start upgrading the codebase from Laravel 6 to Laravel 8 so we gain some new features to play with.
