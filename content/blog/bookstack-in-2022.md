Well 2022 is now in the past so in this post we'll look back across the year to note the
significant developments & changes in both the codebase and management of the project.

### Project Funding & Support Services

With the year now over I now have experience of spending a complete year 
of not being employed, with BookStack being my main focus instead.
I started the year with some support via GitHub sponsors in addition to 
some support from my parents (albeit against my own advisory). 
In the past year the following developments have occurred:

- I [started offering](https://www.bookstackapp.com/blog/bookstack-support-services/) official [paid support services](https://www.bookstackapp.com/support/).
- I created a [focused donation page](https://www.bookstackapp.com/donate/) and added KoFi as a donation option.
- My GitHub sponsors continued to grow.

I've shared some more in-depth thoughts and findings in regards to project financial
in the ["Seven Years of BookStack" post](https://www.bookstackapp.com/blog/7-years-of-bookstack/#working-on-bookstack-full-time--financial-stability), where I also provided some high-level income details.

Now we're at the end of the year, I can provide a more detailed view of things.
The below chart shows rough high-level monthly revenue, excluding taxes:

GitHub sponsors acts as my primary income. The monthly amount is variable due to multiple factors,
The May payment was missed and rolled into June hence those anomalies. The very large amount in December
is thanks to a sponsor pre-paying for a year. 
Sponsorships have continued to grow, both in the base of small contributors in addition to a few large (>£100) monthly sponsors.
Overall, across the year, these have totalled about £11.8k providing a great foundation of income.
The donations via KoFi have helped add to this in the form of additional one-off donations totalling about ~£310.
The support services have also had a positive impact, providing about £3k of revenue since launching to act as a significant secondary source of revenue.

Overall I've seen just over £15k of revenue from these sources over 2022.
While this isn't really anywhere near the expected salary for a full stack lead web developer, 
it reflects some significant growth that indicates that soon covering my living costs could be a 
possibility. I'm about 75% of the way there, with me continuing to take a hit from my savings
for the time being.

A very big thank-you to everyone that has donated or purchased a support service offering, for your
generosity and help in working towards a sustainably funded project.

  - Large range of added visual theme system partials for view customization
  - Added Diagrams.net-specific configuration event

Looking back across that list, it reflects the past year's focus on refinement. 
There's not actually that much new in terms of added subsystems, but there's been a lot of focus 
upon developing, updating & revamping existing core features to strengthen the spine of the platform.

Personally, my favourite feature within the above has to be the [interface shortcuts from our v22.11 release](https://www.bookstackapp.com/blog/bookstack-release-v22-11/#user-interface-shortcuts).
It's something I wanted to add for a long time to empower keyboard-focused workflows and I'm really happy 
with the result which provides full control and customizability along with an overlay help interface to help
show the shortcuts available. 

### YouTube Videos

Last year I started [a BookStack YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/BookStackApp) and I have continued to enjoy
developing these videos throughout 2022. Not only are they super useful to provide on-hand visual guidance, but they
usually attract great positive feedback to keep me motivated.

Since BookStack v22.07 I've enjoyed creating release overview videos which I could really viably do thanks to the 
extra time afforded to working on the project full-time, due to the extra day or so they add to the release process.
These have have a particularly positive reception, and I quite enjoy them as a visual way to show-off or emphasize
work done that would otherwise be difficult to reflect.

Overall I've published 16 videos across the year and we've gone from 90 to over 850 subscribers throughout the year.
Video views have continued to accelerate as more content is created:

While nothing is earnt from videos right now, we'll soon be eligible for monetization which may provide a bonus, yet very minor, revenue source. Growth may also open the door and support other options in the future; for example, sponsored guides in using certain hosting options or integrating with specific third-party services etc...).
The main benefit though is building up this visual community hub to act as a valuable resources in guidance and access to the platform.
