Today we release BookStack v0.20.1. Although this update does not include any major new features it bundles up some big behind-the-scenes changes along with a great deal of fixes and updates.

### Image Improvements

Previously you could upload GIF images but, due to resizing, they would not remain in their animated state once in the page. [Abijeet](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/pull/755) has now fixed this so you can go ahead and litter your pages with animated cat GIFs.

In addition to the Gifs, [Abijeet](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/pull/754) has also fixed many image manager upload issues, in both function and design, to make the image management experience better.

### Icon Overhaul

Previously BookStack used an icon font, thanks to the [material design iconic font](http://zavoloklom.github.io/material-design-iconic-font/icons.html), which worked nice for quick development. Unfortunately though an icon font is hard to customise and limits the icons available to use.

We have now migrated to fully using SVG icons. Things will generally look the same since we're using the same Google Material Design icon set but thanks to being SVG they should now appear sharper, pages will load quicker and the icons will no longer 'flash' into the view. They can also be easily overridden on an individual basis via [theming](/blog/beta-release-v0-20-0/#groundwork-for-theming).
