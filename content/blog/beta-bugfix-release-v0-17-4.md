Since the v0.17 feature release at the start of the month a good bunch of fixes
and feature tweaks have made their way into BookStack.
After 4 bugfix release we're now at version v0.17.4.
Here are some details on the changes made over the last month:

### UTF8mb4 / Emoji Support

As part of v0.17 a database change was included to add support for Emoji.
To achieve this the encoding used in the database was changed upon upgrade.
This upgrade caused issues for many users so has therefore now been removed. This can instead
be done manually by [following the documentation here](/docs/admin/ut8mb4-support/).

### Editor Shortcut Updates

The shortcuts available in both page editors have now been updated with wider format support.
Thanks to changes to the Markdown editor in v0.17 we've now
added some format shortcuts to align the Markdown editor with the WYSIWYG editor.
Documentation pages have been created with details of all currently supported shortcuts:

* [WYSIWYG Editor](/docs/user/wysiwyg-editor/)
* [Markdown Editor](/docs/user/markdown-editor/)

### Translation Updates ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

BookStack now has Polish translations thanks to user [JachuPL](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/pull/435).

Additional French translations have been added and some existing translations have
been cleaned up thanks to work done by [Joorem](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/pull/446).
