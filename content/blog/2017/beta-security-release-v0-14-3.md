Security Bugfix release. Fixes for the following major issue:

* On 404 (Not found) views page/chapter/book names were visible. No content of those items were visible, just the names. This includes instances that had 'public viewing' turned off.

Sincere apologies for this issue.

* [Update instructions](https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/admin/updates)
* [GitHub release page](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/releases/tag/v0.14.3)
