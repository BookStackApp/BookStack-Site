One week after v0.16.0 we have our first v0.16 Bugfix release. This contains the following changes and fixes:

* Fixed permission updates on large books failing due to MySQL placeholder count ([#374](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/issues/374))
* Added functionality to check 'Accept-Language' header to provide translations when not logged in. ([#375](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/issues/375))
* Added HTML support back into the Markdown editor. ([#378](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/issues/378))
* Refactored permission system for general speedups.
