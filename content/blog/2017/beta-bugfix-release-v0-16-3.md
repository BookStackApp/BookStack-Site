Just a quick update on some bugfix point releases. Last month v0.16.2 was released. This fixes issues in the permission system when using the non-native php-mysql driver. More information can be found [in the issue thread here](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/issues/383).

Today an issue with role permissions was picked up. Permissions removed from a role would not take effect. Version 0.16.3 has been released to cover this issue. **If you use the permission system and have removed permissions from roles at any point I'd recommend running the command `php artisan bookstack:regenerate-permissions` from your BookStack install folder to ensure all permissions are set correctly.**
