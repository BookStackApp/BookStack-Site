As we veer towards the middle of July we hit the 8-year mark for the BookStack project.
Following the pattern from [previous years](/blog/7-years-of-bookstack/), we'll compare
the project's various metrics year-on-year, and provide an update on finances.

### Current Financial Stability

I'm coming up to almost two years since leaving my job.
I've been targeting an overall monthly pre-tax revenue of about £2k per month, or a £24k annual salary.
With my very minimal business costs, that would just about cover my somewhat frugal living costs.
I know it's nowhere near the expected salary of a developer, or what I was previously earning as a lead developer,
but that would cover my current needs.

Here's an update view of my overall monthly income, broken down into the main revenue streams for BookStack:

![Monthly revenue breakdown, showing increased revenue for 2023 with support services contributing a more significant portion](/images/2023/07/bookstack_revenue_mid_2023.png)

As you may notice, 2023 has been fairly healthy so far, with an average monthly revenue of just over £2k.
The support service revenue appears much more established. This is due to now getting renewing subscriptions from last year,
in addition to new support subscriptions. Upon that, I've provided a couple of one-off (upgrade assistance) tasks via the
support service which has contributed.
Ko-fi as a donation avenue has grown relative to GitHub sponsors, with a few extra generous >£100 donations coming though that channel in
addition to many smaller & reoccuring donatations.

A massive thanks again to all those donating or using our support services.
You have helped me get to the point of sustaining myself while working on BookStack and open source,
in a way that has no negative impact to the project's integrity and openess,
and I'm amazed at that being possible. With the way things are going I can start to
recover some of my previous loss of savings, and gain a buffer in my monthly finances.

#### Thoughts on the Numbers

TODO - Update

### Reddit & Project Reach

Something on my mind is how changes in the online social landspace, particular on Reddit, may impact the project.
The community on Reddit has been a big part of BookStack's growth, with much of the discovery and word-of-mouth
being via kind and enthusiatic redditors in various communites such as /r/selfhosted, /r/homelab & /r/sysadmin.
It's been an easy place to monitor and be involved with where required.

I've always hardly touched on marketing, prefering natrual growth, but there is a balance to reaching new audiences
to grow users, and those that can help fund/contribute to the platform, as we may also lose existing users natrually over time.
I generally have always had an ever growing velocity, with very gentle acceleration, which works well for managing the project
and keeping growth sustained & steady, but I do consider how external changes may impact that.

Change is inevitble though, I'll just have to watch the landscape evolve and think how we adapt focus to suit.

I have had a question about why we still exist on Reddit, and why we're not on alternatives.
While I don't care nor respect the changes Reddit is making, my focus is on helping users.
I am still getting an active stream of users on the /r/bookstack subreddit requesting support, so I will still serve those users.
In regards to other platforms, I prefer to move slowly on these things since each extra platform to be on has a cost,
so I'm stepping back and keeping an eye on how the alternative landscape establishes itself.
We are [on Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@bookstack) so you can usually connect with us or watch for updates
via there and the connected federated world.
